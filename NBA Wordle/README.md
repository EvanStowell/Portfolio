The NBA Wordle is a version of the popular Wordle browser game but uses NBA players instead of five-letter words. The user has eight tries to determine the mystery NBA player, receiving feedback about their guess’ conference, team, position, height, and number. Text background is added to the guess information as an indication to how the guess information compares to the mystery player’s information. A green background signifies that value in the category matches that of the mystery player and a yellow background indicates that the value in that guess’ category is very close to the mystery player value in that category (Ex. Height: 6-8^ means the guess player’s height is within 2 inches under the mystery player’s height).The number of guesses the user made is recorded after each game and a histogram of their distribution of guesses can be accessed through the menu of the NBA Wordle. The game is strictly played within the shell. The NBA Wordle was created for basketball aficionados to test their NBA player knowledge as well as aspiring fans to strengthen their NBA player knowledge, possibly their interest in the sport simultaneously.
